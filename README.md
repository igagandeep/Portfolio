# 🚀 Portfolio Frontend – Next.js

This is the frontend of my personal portfolio application, built using **Next.js 15** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**. The interface is fully responsive, supports **light/dark mode**, and includes smooth page transitions powered by **Framer Motion**.

The application dynamically fetches project data from a custom backend API (built with Node.js and Express) hosted on **Render**. It uses **Axios** for HTTP requests and **React Context API** for state management. The backend is connected to a **MongoDB Atlas** database, allowing seamless project updates and real-time content control.

The design focuses on performance, animation, and clarity—making it easy to showcase professional work to potential employers and clients.
